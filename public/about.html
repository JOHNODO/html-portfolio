<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a sophisticated web designer who just started developing interest in tech when I was working as a Search Engine Optimizer
   for an AI company where I used to work with very beautifully made websites for various clients, and
   I said to myself, how about I create something like this myself?
</p>

<p>Therefore, I started downloading videos from Youtube where I came acoss
  an online tutor by the name Angela Yu on Udemy and she became my online professor
  And like the say the rest is history
</p>

<p>So after then, I became a Full-Stack Web Developer after getting to learn other languages.
  To date, I can proudly say I have proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuerry, PHP and React.
